    "# Class Work - Fourier Transforms\n",
    "This notebook will be a brief introduction to Fourier Transforms (FT) and their uses in astronomy. The Fourier Transform is one of the most important tools in any sort of signal processing you might be carying out. Developed in the early 1800s to aid in the describe the flow of heat, the Fourier transform allows you to break down *any* signal as a series of sine waves. The key concept to recognize with a FT is that it transforms your data from the time-domain to the frequency-domain. That is to say that if your data represents a seriese of measurments through time (such as a light curve in astronomy) the FT of that data will represent the contributing power of frequencies for that signal. A peak in the FT at some frequency means that frequency strongly contributes to the overall shape of the signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will break this project down into two sections, an analytical section and a practical section. The analytical section will introduce you to Fourier Transforms, how to solve them for some defined function, $f(t)$, and how to understand what they imply. The practical section will introduce you to tools you can use to decompose time series data into frequency space data as as astronomer. \n",
